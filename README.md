# BLE Accelerometer Packet Analyzer

This program analyzes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packets containing accelerometer data. It can process predefined packets and also allows users to input their own packets for analysis.

## Features

- Parses BLE packets to extract:
  - MAC address
  - RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)
  - Accelerometer data (X, Y, Z axes)
- Calculates acceleration magnitude
- Determines if the device is moving or stationary based on acceleration magnitude
- Processes two predefined packets
- Allows user input for custom packet analysis
- Packet you can give to the code from example - 0x0201060303E1FF1216E1FFA10364FFF40011FF033772A33F23AC
